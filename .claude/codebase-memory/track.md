# track.md — Autonomous Car Project

**Split out of `gotchas.md` on 2026-09-02** (Appendix BO). Traps belonging to
the physical track: layout, markings, surface, and what the camera sees of the
environment.

The track's dimensions are driven by the car's MEASURED width — that fact lives
in `hardware.md` (114.75 mm, 2026-09-02), and the generator that consumes it is
`cad/track_layout_v2.py`.

- **3DStreet is a street CROSS-SECTION tool, not a track-geometry tool**
  (assessed 2026-09-01, Appendix AM). It does linear segments plus 90-deg /
  T / dead-end intersections; **no curved streets found**, and it works in
  real-world units (a real lane is 3-3.6 m, this track's is ~0.3 m, roughly
  1/11). **Good for** marking design, dash patterns, sign placement and a
  portfolio render. **Bad for** the figure-8 plan-view geometry, which is
  the actual hard part. Keep the layout in a dimensioned plan. The
  `3dstreet-mcp` server (`.mcp.json`) is a bridge to a LIVE browser tab over
  WebSocket - alpha, no auth token, piggybacks on whichever tab is signed
  in - not a headless generator.
- **CORNER GEOMETRY IS FROZEN until the B3 turning test** (Appendix L, AM.2).
  Minimum turn radius ~ wheelbase / tan(max steer) ~ **330 mm is an ESTIMATE**
  ~~resting on a **130 mm car width that is itself unmeasured** until B2/B3~~
  **- WIDTH IS NOW MEASURED, 2026-09-02: 114.75 mm** (see the entry below), so
  the width input is no longer an estimate. **The radius still is** - it also
  needs wheelbase and max steer angle, neither measured, so
  the ~500-670 mm centreline corner figure remains arithmetic on an estimate.
  Designing the look now is fine; **cutting or printing corner tiles now
  risks a track the car physically cannot drive**.
- **Track: print MARKINGS, not the road surface** (2026-08-05). Full-surface
  printing is ~6.4 kg / ~150-250 h for a minimum loop vs ~0.15 kg / ~6 h for
  markings — 97% less for identical camera input, because at 120×160 the
  camera sees markings, not road. Substrate is dark matte foam board /
  coroplast. Don't let a future session "improve" this back to printed tiles.
- **Track layout must be a FIGURE-8, not an oval** (2026-08-05). A one-handed
  loop teaches the BC model "always steer left" — perfect on the training
  track, useless elsewhere. The figure-8 also provides the intersection for
  the stop sign.
- **A seam running perpendicular to travel reads as a stop bar** to the
  model. Run tile seams parallel to travel where possible (2026-08-05).
- **Lock the camera pitch before data collection and record the angle** —
  changing it mid-dataset silently splits the data into two incompatible
  distributions. Vary LIGHTING across sessions on purpose (real-world domain
  randomization); never vary the camera geometry (2026-08-05).
- **Glare:** glossy plastic under room lighting produces specular highlights
  that wash out markings. Matte everything; if printing surface pieces, print
  face-down on a textured plate (2026-08-05).
- **A stop sign is provably unlearnable by plain BC** (2026-08-05). Stopped
  at the line the image is identical whether to wait or go, so the action
  depends on history, which π(action|image) cannot express (frame-stacking
  gives ~0.2 s at 20 Hz; a stop is 2-3 s). This is a FEATURE of the plan —
  it is the M4 world-model showcase, since the RSSM/MDN-RNN has recurrent
  state. Traffic lights are the opposite: memoryless-learnable (state is
  visible in the frame) but need hardware.
